     Copyright (C) 2012 Alex Gilday (aka. SmallDeadGuy)
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

   The SDGPL is a free public license I devised myself
after searching for a license which allows the creation of
modifications but without re-distribution rights of the whole
source code.

                           Definitions

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed
under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".
"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or
organizations.

   "Modifications" refer to changes of the source code that
do not include the entire program as a whole (ie small
patches and/or feature addition/removal).

   "Total Conversions" refer to modifications of the entire
program, such that it may be run without need of the
original program or resemble previous applications of it.

                       Terms and Conditions

   The original program creator(s) have full rights to the
work and have final decisions on distribution of any
modifications, total conversions or small parts of the
program. This includes the right to remove hosting of the
code and/or program binaries that he/she has not permitted.

   Sections of the source code may not be distributed
unless modified for a specific purpose or permission is
obtained from the program author.   

   Any users of the program may not re-distribute it in it's
entirety. Modifications may be made to the program, for
example, adding features, but these modifications must be
distributed as patches/additions to the code. Any
modifications distributed may not be sold for a profit
without permission given by the original author.

   Total conversions of the program or the program itself may
only be distributed by the original author unless permission
is obtained first. Total conversions, like modifications, may
be sold for a profit but only with permission from the
original author.

   The author reserves the right to remove access to the
program from select people if he wishes, for reasons such as
distributing without permission.
